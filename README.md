# js-drumkit

Team project to build a retro styled dum machine

## Todo:
+ [ ] Add effects to the 2 currently unused sliders (pitch being one)
+ [~] Add labels to the sliders + dials
+ [ ] Add glowing icon of JamDeck
+ [ ] Get a nicer theme selector dial/ switcher
+ [ ] Better samples


## Stretch goals:
+ Ability to record/ save/ playback any snippets
+ Backing track with url input (looping)
    - User can add their own files (.wav/.mp3) by dragging and dropping files
+ Changing preset changes theme (tropical background etc)
+ Mobile friendly version (responsive + scaling)
    - Landscape -> portrait mode (app **stays** landscape when rotating phone)
